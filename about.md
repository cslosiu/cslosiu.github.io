# Who am I?
I love coding since 12. (tbc)

# What is this site?
This site is made by github pages with jekyll. I hesitated many years before moving to this way of making blog. I love the look and feel of such a plain way. I saw a few of such blogs. I could not find simple service existing. 

The reason I finally decided is that I found I could just create a markdown file directly through the github app on my iPhone to post new article. Before, it seems that we need to run jekyll on local machines to build the pages and push everything to server. This is not acceptable as I want writing on the go.

That's what a coder love. The most plain writings.
